# K-mer-based-Bacterial-Identification-KNN-Approach

This project introduces a k-mer based prediction model for bacterial identification, offering computational efficiency compared to traditional alignment techniques. It leverages Biopython and collections for k-mer matching and features an interactive Tkinter GUI for user-friendly DNA sequence comparison. The model uses a FASTA-formatted reference database and applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to achieve high accuracy. Users can input query sequences, view the top matching sequences with their percentages, and access entire sequences through an intuitive interface.
